Task 6 - Generics:

Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes two arrays of the same type and checks if they
have the same elements in the same order.
1. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the
even and odd numbers.
2. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes a list of any type and a target element. It returns
the index of the first occurrence of the target element in the list. Return -1 if the target element cannot be 
found.
3. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes a list of any type and returns it as a new
list with the elements in reverse order.
4. Write a Java program to create a generic method that takes two lists of the same type and merges them into
a single list. This method alternates the elements of each list.
